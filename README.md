Hello-World-
============

THIS is a joke of a pre-primer.

Well, this is my README.COOL.

First time for here, GIthub is so famous that no one work on computer programing 
should ignore it, but seems to early for me to get into there, bucouse I'm totally
a pre-primer, I can't even type fluently. As you can see, English is not my first 
language, and it might takes me some time to fit here. Well, I don't know, really 
hope that here will be a good place that like others say.
